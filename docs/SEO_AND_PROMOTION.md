# 🚀 Strategy: How to Rank #1 on Google & NPM

Ranking at the top of Google search results for terms like "multi-ai wrapper", "node.js openai fallback", or "unified ai sdk" requires a combination of **On-Page Optimization** (which we've already done) and **Off-Page Promotion**.

Here is your step-by-step battle plan.

---

## ✅ Phase 1: On-Page Optimization (Completed)

We have already optimized your repository with:
1.  **Keyword-Rich Description**: "The ultimate Node.js wrapper for OpenAI, Anthropic..." in `package.json`.
2.  **Expanded Keywords List**: Added 15+ relevant tags (`javascript-ai`, `provider-fallback`, etc.).
3.  **High-Converting README**: Added badges, a comparison table (vs LangChain), and clear "Why use this?" sections.
4.  **Structured Headers**: Used H1/H2 tags that match user search intent.

## 📣 Phase 2: Content Marketing (Do This Now)

Google ranks content that has **backlinks** and **social proof**.

### 1. Write a "Show HN" Post on Hacker News
-   **Title**: `Show HN: I built a 2kb wrapper to unify OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini with auto-fallback`
-   **Link**: Direct link to your GitHub repo.
-   **Comment**: Write a short comment explaining *why* you built it (e.g., "I was tired of LangChain's complexity...").

### 2. Post on Reddit
Target these subreddits:
-   `r/javascript`
-   `r/node`
-   `r/webdev`
-   `r/reactjs` (mention it works with React backends)

**Sample Post Title**:
> "I built a tiny Node.js library to handle OpenAI/Anthropic fallbacks automatically. Here's the code."

### 3. Publish on Dev.to and Medium
Write a tutorial article:
-   **Title**: "How to Switch Between OpenAI and Claude in Node.js (in 3 lines of code)"
-   **Content**: Show a problem (vendor lock-in), then show your package as the solution.
-   **Canonical URL**: Link back to your GitHub repo 3-4 times in the article.

## 🔗 Phase 3: Technical SEO & Authority

### 1. Get Listed on "Awesome" Lists
Submit a Pull Request to popular curated lists on GitHub. Getting accepted gives you a high-quality backlink.
-   [Awesome Node.js](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-nodejs)
-   [Awesome Generative AI](https://github.com/steven2358/awesome-generative-ai)
-   [Awesome JavaScript](https://github.com/sorrycc/awesome-javascript)

### 2. Create a Documentation Site
GitHub READMEs rank well, but a dedicated documentation site ranks *better*.
-   Use **Docusaurus** or **Nextra** to build a static site (e.g., `multi-ai-wrapper.com` or `mehulbirare.github.io/multi-ai-wrapper`).
-   Google treats dedicated sites as more authoritative than just a repo.

---

## 📈 Phase 4: Maintenance

### 1. Release Frequent Updates
Google loves "fresh" content. 
-   Release `v1.0.2`, `v1.0.3` regularly with small improvements.
-   Update the `README.md` regularly.

### 2. Engage with Issues
-   Encourage users to open issues.
-   Respond quickly.
-   Active repos rank higher on GitHub search, which feeds into Google.

### 3. Get Stars (Social Proof)
-   Ask friends/colleagues to star the repo.
-   More stars = higher perceived authority = more clicks from search results.
